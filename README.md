# Social Network API

## Author: Thomas Stranick

## Description
The Social Network API is designed to be the backend for any social network. Through a combination of express, MongoDB, and Mongoose, all the functionality of a base social network can be achieved. Users can be created along with their unique username and email. Thoughts can be created which are essentially posts on the social network site. They contain some form of text and relate to the user who created it. Users can also add reactions to thoughts that also contain text and the username. Users can friend users and store them within their friendslist where your count is displayed. Each of these can also be updated and deleted if needed.

## Usage
To use the Social Network API, use Insomnia or another route tester. Here, one can GET either all Users or Thoughts, or only a singular User or Thought. Users, Thoughts, and Reactions can all be created (POST), as well as friends added to another User. Users and Thoughts can be updated (PUT), as well as deleted (DEL) along with Reactions and Friends.
